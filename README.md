This project is focussed on developing a book recommender system based on two recommender systems:

1. **Popularity-Based Recommender**
2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**

The model is trained on [book-recommendation-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset) which contains **1,149,780 ratings** (explicit / implicit) on **271,379 books** by **278,858 users**.
